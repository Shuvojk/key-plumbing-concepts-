Plumbing defined:

Plumbing, in general, refers to the system as well as the material fixtures and the apparatus used inside a building for supplying water, removing the used water with other liquid and water-borne wastes as well as the connected ventilating system.

The three roles a competent plumber must assume are:
1. To design, install and maintain water supply and waste removal systems; 
2. To manage health risk and cost associated with plumbing; 
3. To help conserve water.
 
Any building however costly, without     proper plumbing system, is only a skeleton. Proper plumbing alone adds life to the building. Hence proper plumbing system as per the code of practices with the correct specifications of materials like pipes and fixtures should be used to make buildings sustainable

1. The rain water pipe should generally be connected to the street drain/storm water drain and local authority clearance is required for connecting to the sewer system.

Terms related with Plumbing :

Back Flow: The act of water traveling from one system back into any part of the main distribution system (usually by siphoning).

Back Flow Preventer: A device to prevent back flow i.e. into a potable water supply. Usually required for sprinkler systems, hand held showers, pullout faucet spouts, kitchen sprayers, etc.

Back Pressure: Pressure that resists the flow of fluid in a piping system. Back Siphonage: The negative pressure that causes back flow. Back Vent: Plumbing fixture’s separate vent in a building drainage system. Back Wash: The process of cleaning a filter by reversing the flow of water through it. Accumulated sediments are sent to waste.

Back Siphonage: The negative pressure that causes back flow. Black Water: The discharge from water closet and urinal is called Black water.

Biological filters: It is a Soil Absorption Systems used to treat the effluent from the ST where the soil is relatively impervious, water logged areas or where limited land area is available.

Building Drain (BD): The building drain is the part of the lowest horizontal piping of a drainage system which receives the discharge from soil,waste and other drainage pipes inside the walls of the building and conveys it to the building sewer beginning one meter outside the building wall.

Water saving/conservation techniques in plumbing :
Water conservation: Refers to strategies, actions and techniques adopted to use water wisely. This is important as:

• Fresh water is a scarce resource
• Water tables are fast depleting
• Rainfall is unpredictable &
• Moral responsibility to conserve water for future generation

Did you know?


70%of the earth’s surface is covered with water, but only 2.5% of that water is fresh water. Of this only 30% is available for drinking as groundwater and is relatively easily obtainable.




Importance of water conservation to house / building septic system:

Water conservation is not only important from a sustainable consumption perspective but also relevant to house –septic systems / environment.

• Extends the life of septic system by reducing soil saturation
• Reduces any pollution due to leaks from septic tank with excess water
• Over loaded municipal sewer systems can also cause untreated sew age to flow to lakes and rivers.
• Lesser the amount of water flowing through septic systems, the lower the likelihood of pollution





The different ways to conserve / save water in plumbing are listed below:

1. Water conservation products such as Automatic taps, Flushometers, Pint flush urinals, high efficiency toilets and water saving shower heads can also be used. Standard showerheads use about 11 lpm and performance shower heads use about 8 lpm. The older toilets flush with about 13 litres per flush. New high-efficiency dual flush toilets use less than 6 litres per flush.

2. Leakages Check for leakage in the pipe line and faucets and seal them. It is estimated that faucet leaks a drop per second will account to 15-30 litres per day.

3. Water meters –It is important to install water meters in key pipe line connection. This will help measure the water usage and can help in measuring output of any efforts to conserve water.

4. Flow control devices -Significant water savings results from simply installing new faucet flow-control devices (aerators).

5. Grey water use -Grey water can be used by home owners for home gardening, lawn maintenance, landscaping, and other innovative uses with moderate treatment.
